He mostly fought in Irkutsk, even created his own squadron there, Nestor had a nickname - Grandfather. In 1919 the Bolsheviks offered Grandfather's cooperation with great concessions to which he agreed. In 1922 he was killed by Yakut rebels.n\Kalandarishvili cooperated with the Bolsheviks, but it is not a fact that they could get along with him for a long time, for example, his namesake Ukrainian anarchist Nestor Makhno was often deceived by the Bolsheviks saying that they would deliver supplies, which eventually led to the defeat of his movement. We can reclaim the territories in which he fought to honor his memory. But we can also believe the Bolsheviks, because they did not harm him in any way during his lifetime, on the contrary, Kalandarishvili was even a member of the RCP(b), and because of that we can enlist their support."
