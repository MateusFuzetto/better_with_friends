 pci_events.2.desc:0 "Victory in the civil war is ours, but our heavy reliance on Soviet aid has meant we have accrued a significant debt that must be repaid. The chaotic period of the civil war has also meant that Stalinists have managed to work themselves into key positions in our new military and government. We find ourselves therefore in a difficult position.\n\nMoscow has already begun making "suggestions" for appointments of ministers and officers loyal to them, and for now we cannot resist their demands without severe economic repercussions, or worse, sparking a new civil war. If we wish to obtain true independence, we must play our cards carefully and either prove our loyalty, or first undermine and dismantle Stalinist influence on our state."
