[h1][b]Information[/b][/h1]
This mod brings the, slightly changed, monuments mechanic from [i]Europa Universalis IV[/i] to [i]Hearts of Iron IV[/i].

[h1][b]Features[/b][/h1]
Currently the mod adds [b][u]181[/u][/b] monuments in total.
A list of all monuments can be found [u][url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2496490517/3094515496025840512/]here[/url][/u].

Monuments are special things in states that can give bonuses to the state as well as its owner. Some of them are locked to being one of a group of specific nations or fulfilling other requirements, some are available for all nations if they own and control the state.
Each monument has the four possible levels "Destroyed/Not Build", "Noteworthy", "Significant" and "Magnificent". Each level gives a stronger bonus than the one before, with the level "Destroyed/Not Build" (level 0) giving no bonuses. The owner of a state in which a monument is located can upgrade the monument to a higher level, if he controls the state and fulfills the monument's requirements. Upgrading a monument costs Political Power and takes some time, which cannot be boosted like in EU4.

A game rule allows to change this system slightly to not require ownership of the state and affect the owner, but the controller of the state. This game rule will result in faster monument "owner" changes, thus allowing to utilize monuments outside of the starting states faster. However it will potentially also result in more frequent downgrades of monuments.

Monuments can be viewed and interacted with in the state view as well as in a new window, which shows all existing monuments. This window can be opened with a button in the top right of the top bar, left to the date controls.
Since that position can be a bit problematic for lower resolutions, there is a console command that can be used in single player to move it elsewhere. The console command is [b]move_monuments_list_button X Y[/b] (where X and Y are placeholders for the specific number for the X and Y coordinates, e.g. [b]move_monuments_list_button -50 0[/b] would move it 50 pixels to the left from its default position).

AI nations will also build and upgrade monuments, however to prevent them from investing their Political Power purely into them, they will only consider doing this if they have at least 300 Political Power available.
There is a game rule to change this thresthold, however it may impact AI negatively (e.g. by making it neglect other stuff like laws and advisors or monuments).
Another game rule exists to remove the Political Power cost fully for AI countries. Choosing that option will result in AI being able to upgrade monuments faster and more often without any drawbacks.

[/list]
[*] should be compatible with most mods
[list]
[*] however there can be problems with mods that change or remove vanilla content, such as ideologies, or that set replace path for the folders this mod uses
[*] mods that change the map or start date should in theory still be compatible, but it might lead to monuments making no sense in the time or state they will be put into
[*] there are compatibility patch mods for [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2532025777]Kaiserreich[/url], [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2532028792]Hearts of Iron IV: The Great War Redux[/url], [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2544135230]The Road to 56[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2544137591]Kaiserredux: A Kaiserreich Expansion[/url]

[h1][b]Credits[/b][/h1]
A few graphics were taken from [i]Europa Universalis IV[/i].
The images of the monuments were usually taken from old photos or images and then changed.
The descriptions of the monuments were mostly taken from wikipedia and adapted to fit into the game's time frame, if possible.
Thanks to [i]iCodeMaster[/i] for making the shader file to allow desaturate monument icons when disabled.
